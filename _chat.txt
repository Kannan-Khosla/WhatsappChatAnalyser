But ideally you're saving time by taking those courses in the spring, even if you lose a couple hundred dollars in administration fees

[2022-07-30, 10:53:00 PM] ~ 🤓: Hi INDSA family! A special event is happening among the Indian community here in Edmonton this coming weekend. Do check it out, and register if you are interested!

Are you living an unfulfilled life? Are you experiencing depression, oppression,  frustration, pain, illness(es), ailment(s), sleep paralysis, recurring nightmares, failure(s), or just a general emptiness? This coming Saturday morning, on August 6th from 8:30 AM to 10:30 AM, we who are on the Western Pentecostal Conference Coordination Committee have a special session dedicated to minister to those needs.
*
"To tarry" means to linger in expectation, or to abide or remain at a place. We call it "The Tarry Meeting" because we won’t just say a prayer and move on, but will wait on the Lord to move on behalf your needs, especially for those who haven’t received the Holy Spirit. Pr. Prakash Mathews from Dallas will be ministering in this session, along with our very own WPC 2022 English Worship Team.
*
We invite you to tarry with us, as we eagerly await and expect God to do great things in this meeting. Whether it be the infilling of the Holy Spirit, healings, miracles, or deliverance, we know lives will be changed forever and we invite you to become a part of this special event. This is a free event, and no funds will be solicited, collected, or expected at this meeting, which is a part of a special annual conference being held in Edmonton this year, WPC 2022, hosted by Life Church. If you do nothing, nothing will change; if you do something, maybe something can change.
 *
Please note: WPC 2022 will begin on Thursday evening, with meetings throughout the day on Friday and Saturday, and the concluding meeting on Sunday morning. Pr. Prakash will be speaking at all English meetings on Friday and Saturday, and will be available for a panel on Friday afternoon to receive questions. In addition, Pr. Sunil Francis (Goa, India) will be our second guest speaker for all the meetings on Friday and Saturday. Meals and snacks will be freely provided before and after each service, including traditional Indian food for each dinner (vegetarian and halal options will be available). A second tarry meeting is being planned and prepared for on Sunday evening, with the venue to be confirmed, pending sufficient interest. Feel free to contact the English section coordinator, Jeffry Kochikuzhyil, at 780-245-0065 if you have any questions or concerns.
*
It would help us with food and transportation planning if you can register here: https://forms.gle/fF8NntxAiv8VJ9QeA The form must be completed by Wednesday, August 3rd at 10:00pm to confirm your attendance. If you require a ride, please meet us in front of TD Bank in Southgate Mall before the last call. Pick up and drop off can also be done to and from the University of Alberta campus, given extenuating circumstances with prior written communication.

[2022-08-12, 9:39:29 AM] ~ Ips: For anyone still interested- 
I asked the program assistant for the airport welcome and she informed me that the shuttle will drop off at international and lister centre only (in campus) . However she still suggests to take the shuttle to campus and then ask the shuttle driver for instructions on how to take a taxi to your place as it might be cheaper that way. 

Hope this helps! ✌🏻

[2022-08-30, 6:18:35 PM] Sohal: A room is available in a 3 bedroom apartment. 2 girls are already living there. I need someone to takeover my lease for me. It ends in February but you can extend it after. The place is very near to Southgate LRT. It’s like a 10 mins walk and the bus stop is also super close it’s right outside the building. The rent is $466 + utilities which aren’t a lot so it usually adds up to about $500 a month. If you’re interested please call 7806552029

[2022-10-21, 11:46:38 PM] ~ Jay Pasrija: Greetings fam,

We hope your midterms are going well. First off, thanks for showering all your love and appreciation to our Navratri event! Hope you all had an experience to cherish ❤️ We will be releasing media/gallery shortly (since our media team too have midterms lol).

We have had been getting a lot of responses to know if something is cooking for Diwali too, so wanted to make it clear. We have had been planning for Diwali, but due to lack of staff at Horowitz Events center (As a Registered Student Group, we get the best on-campus location(s) at a discounted pricing), there is no availability of location around this Diwali Week. So, we have requested a booking around the first week of November. If that works out, we will plan Diwali+Halloween Party together (near reading week) so we can again accomodate maximum students (since a lot of students have midterms this week). If we get a positive response for on-campus location availability, we will post it on our social media. Further details will be communicated (transparently!). Efforts Assured 💫

Wishing you all a wonderful weekend 💌
[2022-10-22, 12:01:34 AM] ~ Rahul Bakshi: Hello Everyone 😇
First off thanks for becoming the part of Navratri Event and making it a hit. We tried our best  so that we all can enjoy this festive season together (as we say INDSA is your home away from home 🏠 ❤️). So we hope you guys enjoyed a lot.

We wanted to do something same for the Diwali to get everyone under one roof and to enjoy the night together. We tried our level best but the due to pre-bookings of the venues in the university, we are not able to do so.

However, at INDSA we are trying our best to still organize a wonderful event for our fam ❤️ and will continue to do to in the coming months.

So stay tuned and if you are not following us on instagram, please do so to get all the updates. 

Hope you all have a wonderful Diwali 🪔 🎉

Rahul Bakshi
Secretary, INDSA

[2022-11-14, 6:51:42 AM] ~ Nikita Surani: Hi Everyone!

I'm moving from Mumbai to study at the UofA next month. 

I was wondering if any of you have tried the FIDO sim card for local mobile communication in Canada? If yes, would someone be able to tell me more about your experiences using it.

Thanks!
[2022-11-14, 8:05:52 AM] ~ Bhavya Shah: I am using Fido student plan 
45 dollars per month 10gb data
[2022-11-14, 8:06:43 AM] ~ Salman: Mine was 17 gigs at 45$ including India calling
[2022-11-14, 8:52:42 AM] ~ 💫Surabhi Lukose💫: In my opinion it's really good and affordable. Also, u can always change the SIM after coming here incase if u want to
[2022-11-14, 8:55:28 AM] ~ Sharu: I am using Lucky Mobile which is really cheap (20cad) has very good connection across Canada. I recommend that. Because you will be always connected to internet on campus
[2022-11-14, 9:32:49 AM] ~ Nikita Surani: Thanks Bhavya and Salman! Is the India calling completely free with your plans or are there set number of free calling hours? Also did you guys get your Fido sim from India or after landing in Edmonton?
[2022-11-14, 9:33:09 AM] ~ Salman: 1000 mina
[2022-11-14, 9:33:14 AM] ~ Salman: *mins
[2022-11-14, 9:33:18 AM] ~ Bhavya Shah: 1000 mins
[2022-11-14, 9:33:28 AM] ~ Salman: Mine was now upgraded 1500 mins
[2022-11-14, 9:33:36 AM] ~ Rajdeepsinh Solanki: But you have to ask them for this offer
[2022-11-14, 9:33:39 AM] ~ Nikita Surani: Thanks Surabhi! Yeah I read that on their website. Did u get yours while you were in India ?
[2022-11-14, 9:33:42 AM] ~ Salman: Per month
[2022-11-14, 9:34:15 AM] ~ Nikita Surani: Thanks Sharu for that lead. Will explore that as well.
[2022-11-14, 9:34:58 AM] ~ Nikita Surani: Thank you everyone for your responses. Really appreciate ☺️🙏
[2022-11-14, 9:45:11 AM] ~ Sapna: Hi everyone 

I am a new postdoc joing U of A  very soon from India.

Can anyone plz tell what the is total deduction from fellowship amount/month?
[2022-11-14, 9:49:26 AM] ~ Subho: If you are funded by GRAF, you do not have to pay any taxes
‎[2022-11-14, 9:49:53 AM] ~ Salman: ‎image omitted
[2022-11-14, 9:50:25 AM] ~ Salman: If anyone’s looking for apartments contact this guy
[2022-11-14, 9:50:57 AM] ~ Subho: For GRA and GTA the taxes are calculated as you would for a normal job, so it depends on the stipend
[2022-11-14, 9:51:44 AM] ~ Subho: But I think postdoc would count as a normal job so I wouldnt be too sure
[2022-11-14, 9:54:17 AM] ~ Nikita Surani: Yes i think subho is right. I was doing the INTD 710 course and it mentions that taxes are deducted from RA and TA positions but for GRAF there probably aren't any deductions.
[2022-11-14, 9:54:39 AM] ~ Nikita Surani: Maybe confirm the same with the FGSR
[2022-11-14, 9:56:47 AM] ~ Sapna: can u plz explain GRAF, and other abriviations..
[2022-11-14, 9:57:10 AM] ~ Nikita Surani: Graduate Research Assistant Fellowship

[2022-11-14, 9:57:33 AM] ~ Nikita Surani: RA means research assistant
[2022-11-14, 9:57:39 AM] ~ Nikita Surani: TA means teaching assistant
[2022-11-14, 9:57:57 AM] ~ Bhavya Shah: University will pay you for working in one of their projects 

I am a GRAF student
[2022-11-14, 9:59:01 AM] ~ Sapna: Ok thank you

Thank u

[2022-11-14, 3:55:39 PM] ~ Daniel: Hi there, you will have ~20% tax deduction from your paycheque.
[2022-11-14, 4:00:51 PM] ~ Daniel: Let’s say…your annual pay is 50,000. So after taxes it would be 40,000/ 12 months = ~3,333 per month. And you will be paid semi monthly, which mean you will get a paycheque of ~1666 on the 10th and another ~1666 on 25th of every month.
[2022-11-14, 5:04:13 PM] ~ Sapna: Thank you Daniel.. Great help

[2022-11-30, 3:35:25 PM] ~ 🤓: Hi friends!

There is a free Christmas party and dinner this Friday evening at a church here in Edmonton, in collaboration with a campus student group (the International Friendship Group). A bus will be leaving from Hub mall and dropping students back to campus afterwards, for those who need transportation. If you're interested in joining, please do register!

[2022-11-30, 3:36:53 PM] ~ 🤓: The same group will be having a Christmas camp from Dec 21 to Dec 24, after finals. The cost is $350, but I can say that it is definitely worth it, and you can enjoy the Canadian winter on a campground with good people. Send me a message if you're interested, and I'll connect you with the organizers. Seats are limited! :)

[2022-12-15, 2:57:41 AM] ~ Jay Pasrija: Not a grad student, but based on what I know, grad students who were registered full-time in Fall 2022 have already been assessed with the GSA health and dental plan fees (non-instructional), so it's mandatory for them now as the change-of-coverage period was September 1-26. However, students starting in Winter 2022 (as full-time students) still have an option to opt out (not recommended) because the change-of-coverage period for them is Jan 03-Jan 24.

[2022-12-29, 11:38:42 PM] ~ Rahul Bakshi: So either a student can pay complete two year fees at one go in September or
They have optometrist to pay in 2 instalment 
1year fee in September and 2nd year fee in Jan
[2022-12-29, 11:39:38 PM] ~ Rahul Bakshi: To check that kindly check your offer letter
If your complete two year fees is mentioned under 1year column and in 2nd year it is mentioned just *fees

Then you have to pay complete fees in 1 year

[2023-02-23, 12:57:14 PM] ~ 🤓: Hi friends,

Just wanted to share about a new scam that is out there, since one of our friends called me this week asking about it. Basically, a scammer will contact you regarding employment or some other application in which your provided your contact information. They will mail you a cheque and then claim to have sent extra money, and ask you to refund the rest. When you deposit the cheque and send them the money, there appears to be no issue, until the cheque bounces a few days later and the bank withdraws all the added funds to your account. Thus, the scammer will pocket all the money that you sent to them, while you owe that amount to the bank. Report anyone attempting to this, and stay safe!

Jeffry

That could be via free food, networking opportunities, or providing some sort of community, among other examples. Going forward, this may be a good rule of thumb for future reference: that we may freely invite one another without promoting any particular ideology, belief system, or way of thinking.

Hope this is acceptable to everyone :)
[2023-03-06, 4:38:53 AM] ~ Thirupathi Reddy: Sorry prabhujis & mathajis (masters & mothers). I come from a rural background and do not know the nuances of a highly cultured society. So I might have hurt your secular feelings. Jeffrey bhai, I am inspired by you for your efforts and need your blessings as well.

The reason I did not camouflage my message unlike I did last time was that not a single person here knew who Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is. They might think him to be a Bollywood celebrity and this event to be an opportunity to dance in delirium with half-naked organic machines to some incoherent music that agitates the core of your consciousness without you noticing the telltale signs of it and taking delight in body parts of some other helpless organic machines.

They might take out some time from their busy schedule to only be surprised to see some bright-faced Vaishnava souls dancing in ecstasy glorifying the holy names of their beloved Lord (hare krishna maha mantra) and later take delight in honoring the food remnants (maha prasadam) offered as Bhoga to the Lord.

*RELIGION IS NOT ANOTHER FORM OF SENSE GRATIFICATION. IT IS A WAY TO LOVE THEIR BELOVED GOD (PATHS CAN BE DIFFERENT BUT THE GOAL IS THE SAME). SECULARISM IS NOT INTOLERANCE, IT IS INDIFFERENCE AND THE REASON FOR HARMONY IN INDIA*

Shit happens and by "shit" I mean "people"😂
[2023-03-06, 6:56:15 AM] ~ Thirupathi Reddy: That's lovely, please make time. We shall dance for the pleasure of Gauranga & Nityananda. Become high without mundane intoxication 🤩
[2023-03-06, 9:21:26 AM] ~ Pragati Shaw: I'll try my best to do it. Thank you for the share.
[2023-03-06, 10:06:01 AM] ~ 🤓: Sure, please share the event link or poster, and people are free to attend as they like. We can accomplish this without in-depth discussions in the main group, in order to avoid detracting from the primary purpose and function of the group. 

All in here are studying and working, and juggle very busy lives and schedules, with varying deadlines and priorities, so all we can do is offer opportunities beyond each student's present bubble, but it is up to them to take advantage of what is presented before them.

Hope this courtesy is felt by all group members and extended to all group members, regardless of their identities, communities, and affiliations.
[2023-03-07, 11:49:59 AM] ~ Akanksha Goel: Hello everyone, 
 
• Do you want to nurture future leaders while building your leadership skills and make a difference?
• Are you interested in international development and achieving UNSDGs? 
 
I have an amazing opportunity for you to join the inaugural leadership team of a student club at the University of Alberta.
 
The club will work to support JIVAM Foundation that provides quality education to hundreds of students in rural India. It will entail working on knowledge exchange such as building a leadership curriculum for students and fundraising. Additionally, there will be opportunities to attend conferences on behalf of JIVAM and do field work in India.
 
If you are interested in becoming a part of it, please fill out the form below. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. 
 
Thank you,
Akanksha

I hope you all are doing great!

Because got a few inquiries from students on tax filing, I thought of sharing this in case you find this helpful, knowing the accounting club at the University of Alberta is no more running Tax clinics. 

Anyone who still is left with their tax filing, and is looking for free services (but not sure if it is legit or not), then there are more official free tax clinic services in Edmonton (which are officially registered under CRA). 

Dropping a link for your reference:
https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program.html

You can find the tax clinic in Edmonton by selecting filters under "Find a Tax clinic in your area" link. 

It covers all possibilities (students can select drop-by/appointment/virtual whichever is convenient for them, and can also select if they are filing taxes for the Current year only, or Current and last year only, or Current and prior years to match them accordingly! They also have the option to select if they wish to seek help in the Hindi language. Just in case anyone feels more comfortable in hindi for doing taxes the first time! I hope this helps:)

Outgoing Secretary, Indian Students’ Association at the University of Alberta(INDSA)


I suggest to all fall 2023 people that it is better to create a separate group. Two-three people can take a charge. And add people only who have got the admits. You can request for the offer letter screenshot and ask people to hide their personal information except course and year.
I made the similar group back in 2021 when I came to the university.

It was really helpful for people from same state, course to connect. Find their travel partners, help in filing visa.
Help in finding roommates based on their preferences.
Course selection and lot more.
[2023-05-24, 7:25:48 PM] ~ Rahul Bakshi: You guys can add me in the group if you want as people from previous year also did.

I can answer to your queries to the best of my knowledge and will try to help you out to make the transition little smoother.

Thanks and Congratulations to all who have got the admit to the UofA 🎉🎉🎉

All the best 👍🏻

It's upto you if you want to continue with the same provider. It worked perfectly for me for the first 2 weeks when I was settling in after which I bought a new plan from a different provider. There's no cost involved, just make sure to activate the number.

[2023-06-08, 6:21:48 PM] ~ 😊: Hello all, 

I need one bedroom appartment for my family under 800 CAD .

I have seen broawalk and other 1 bedroom buildings close to University, but they all have rent  more than 1200 CAD.

Today I saw Mainstreet one bedroom appartmet in downtown, but the rent is 930 excluding electricity and internet. There are some other mainstreet one bedroom appartment in the range 800 CAD, however from inside they have very bad maintenance.

On marketplace, rentfaster.ca and kijiji, 90 percent of properties  advertised are just single room rather than the one bedroom appartment. 

Looking for lease agent contact or good recommendations for one bedroom appartment.

If someone could share contact number of lease agent.
[2023-06-08, 6:43:27 PM] ~ Hemant More: You should be able to find one bedroom apartment on market place and other websites you have mentioned

[2023-06-13, 9:20:59 PM] ~ 😊: Good Evening, 

Need good suggestion regarding deposit payment.

If I hava a doubt on paying deposit to a  landlord, then what should I do to make this process safer  like is it safe to pay  deposit via interac etransfer to his or her name ?

May I request bank details from the landlord to pay the deposit like bank name & address, transit no, institution no, and account no?
[2023-06-13, 9:30:34 PM] ~ Hemant More: Damage deposit is required by landlord if you are renting and is refundable once you complete the lease and leave with no damage
[2023-06-13, 9:31:17 PM] ~ Hemant More: Interac is safe and I am assuming you are signing a lease agreement
[2023-06-13, 9:35:20 PM] ~ 😊: She is saying to pay deposit before agreement. She has sent me an application form which needed all of details. 

At the end of the form there is consent section in which I am allowing her for background check.

Conclusion, its not an agreement rather just a background check application.

[2023-06-13, 9:38:09 PM] ~ Hemant More: It says on the application form that deposit is refundable
[2023-06-13, 9:38:21 PM] ~ Hemant More: You can negotiate with her
[2023-06-13, 9:39:24 PM] ~ Salman: If she is a building manager,it will be legit
[2023-06-13, 9:39:31 PM] ~ Hemant More: Landlord have to do their due diligence before they rent

[2023-06-13, 11:56:28 PM] ~ saumyaa: There are lot of scams circulating as September is peak intake for Canada. It's best to land and then search. Till then manage with some airbnb Or hotels.
[2023-06-13, 11:57:32 PM] ~ .: I agree. A lot of them are frauds.
[2023-06-13, 11:57:33 PM] ~ saumyaa: I was asked for application fee for having a visit in the apt and it was refundable. But the owner was reluctant to share address before visiting. I found it fishy.
[2023-06-13, 11:58:20 PM] ~ .: Or you can search online but tell them that you will pay money after you will be there
[2023-06-13, 11:58:44 PM] ~ .: But do not transfer any money before hand
[2023-06-13, 11:59:32 PM] ~ saumyaa: They would then say our flat is in demand. We have many other visitors and you need to be quick to make this decision. All of this is like mini India over there.
[2023-06-14, 12:00:16 AM] ~ .: If you are joining a lab, you can ask your new labmates if they could check the place that you are looking for is legitimate or not.

Still living in one of them.
[2023-06-14, 1:35:40 AM] ~ Nikita Surani: I found a place from India through a common contact so I could trust the landlord and paid the refundable deposit before I landed - and it wasn't a scam. But I knew them. Dont pay unless you know or can trust private home owners. Also, some of the known apartment complexes ask for refundable deposit too, are those trustworthy?
[2023-06-14, 2:23:26 AM] ~ Srinjoy Bhuiya: Hey which area are you living at?

Will the no vaccine/only 1 vaccine status affect his/her visa approval or medical approval chances?

[2023-06-22, 1:44:54 AM] ~ Pragati Shaw: I'm not sure what others do but i think carry on is a better option. Just in case they ask you for a prescription and check your medicines. I don't know if this has ever happened but just a personal choice.
[2023-06-22, 1:46:43 AM] ~ Pragati Shaw: I have found fido better in terms of connectivity than freedom but I guess the price range is slightly higher for Fido

[2023-07-19, 11:13:14 AM] ~ SGandhi👀: Has anyone recently filed for a USA visitor visa from Canada on a study permit?

Would there be a case that they would email you saying that there are earlier empty slots available for the rescheduling of the appointment?
[2023-07-19, 11:17:22 AM] ~ Jay Pasrija: Yup. 
No, they do not send emails for the same.
[2023-07-19, 11:22:25 AM] ~ .: No, they do not but keep monitoring at least once two weeks. New slots open up more frequently. I got my appointment in 1.5 month
[2023-07-19, 11:26:06 AM] ~ SGandhi👀: Thank you, people! My brother received an email with a link for an early appointment slot, and that didn't make sense.
[2023-07-19, 11:27:12 AM] ~ SGandhi👀: Is there any specific time during the day you might have targeted for checking the available slots?
Or is it random guess?
[2023-07-19, 11:28:12 AM] ~ .: Just randomly. I used to check once every week or at least once in every 2 weeks.

[2023-07-19, 12:15:28 PM] ~ Jay Pasrija: I had the appointment in Aug 2023 when I made my application. I usually check it at midnight to see if the system updated the available slots, in less than a week, one of the slots opened up and I booked the appointment that was in less than a month. So, I guess maybe refresh the site at midnight if you get lucky.
[2023-07-19, 12:25:01 PM] ~ Salman: Also there are certain telegram grps which post whenever slots are released

[2023-08-05, 7:06:04 AM] ~ ࿇Umesh࿇😇: What's the Ebike prospects in Edmonton
[2023-08-05, 7:06:05 AM] ~ ࿇Umesh࿇😇: Will this idea work?
[2023-08-05, 7:27:56 AM] ~ Gursimar Singh: in snow no
[2023-08-05, 7:41:56 AM] ~ ࿇Umesh࿇😇: How many months snow is there?
[2023-08-05, 7:42:16 AM] ~ Gursimar Singh: 7-8
[2023-08-05, 9:13:44 AM] ~ anantttttt: yes i was also wondering if buying a bicycle for daily commute is a good idea?
[2023-08-05, 9:16:15 AM] ~ 17807291809: Been using it alot recently for the winters you need to get appropriate tires and use appropriate clothing then it can be done but not on some days which are like less than -30 (depends on what you wear and how well your body adjusts to the cold)
[2023-08-05, 9:21:15 AM] ~ anantttttt: considering the fact that i am a student, buying a new bike and winters tyres is it affordable? i might be able to shed a few extra bucks because i really love cycling
[2023-08-05, 9:21:57 AM] ~ 17807291809: If you really love cycling then yes you could get a used bike from kijiji or Facebook marketplace
[2023-08-05, 9:22:19 AM] ~ 17807291809: Used bikes are value for money if you do your research properly
[2023-08-05, 9:25:57 AM] ~ anantttttt: i hope you don't mind can you tell me what to look for and watch out for when buying a used cycle?
[2023-08-05, 9:26:26 AM] ~ ࿇Umesh࿇😇: So how many days in a year can we use bicycle?....... Winter tires are expensive? How much?
[2023-08-05, 9:27:11 AM] ~ 17807291809: Good ones can be 50ish dollars on sale
[2023-08-05, 9:28:16 AM] ~ 17807291809: For winter biking and stuff I would suggest that you guys should check out Edmontoncycling on reddit
[2023-08-05, 9:29:01 AM] ~ 17807291809: They have many threads on what to look for and what not to
[2023-08-05, 9:29:40 AM] ~ 17807291809: If the price is suspiciously low it can be stolen so keep that in mind
[2023-08-05, 9:30:21 AM] ~ anantttttt: also does bargaining work in Edmonton?
[2023-08-05, 9:30:41 AM] ~ 17807291809: For used stuff yes
[2023-08-05, 9:31:35 AM] ~ anantttttt: how much should one bargain like 25%?
[2023-08-05, 9:32:07 AM] ~ 17807291809: I got a ccm mountain bike the owner listed it for 220 dollars I got it for 170
[2023-08-05, 9:33:26 AM] ~ anantttttt: alright! that gives me a fair idea
[2023-08-05, 9:33:34 AM] ~ anantttttt: thanks a lot for helping us out
[2023-08-05, 10:41:29 AM] ~ Nandan Ramesh: I've biked throughout the year. It's doable if you have the right gear and dress right. The most important ones are good mitts (or bar mitts - people call them pogies here), headcovering, snow goggles. You need to dress like it's 10 degrees warmer cuz you'll start sweating once you bike for a bit. Also, make sure to get a good lock (aim for one that's 30% - 50% of the bike's value) cuz theft is kinda bad here, especially on campus.

[2023-08-05, 11:01:51 AM] ~ Vinay: Not necessarily,  get a kryptonite lock. It's around a 100 bucks and you should be good
[2023-08-05, 11:37:39 AM] ~ Nandan Ramesh: Yeah, a good u-lock or chain lock should work.
[2023-08-05, 11:49:32 AM] ~ 17807291809: Yeah look online you can find good deals on u locks
